Sleep Detection System using MobileNetV2

This project is a real-time sleep detection system developed using deep learning and computer vision. The system identifies whether a person is awake or sleepy based on eye images captured through a webcam. A MobileNetV2 transfer learning model is used for classification.

The main goal of this project is to build a lightweight and efficient drowsiness detection system that can work in real time.

Project Overview

The model is trained on eye images that are classified into two categories:

Awake

Sleepy

During real-time execution, the webcam captures the face, detects the eye region using OpenCV Haar cascade, and sends the eye image to the trained model for prediction. The output is displayed on the screen along with a confidence score.

Training the Model

Training is required only once, unless the dataset or model is modified.

python train.py

The trained model will be saved in the models folder.

Testing the Model

To evaluate model performance on the test dataset:

python test.py

Running Real-Time Detection

To start webcam-based detection:

python app/live_sleep_detection.py
